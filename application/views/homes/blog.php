            <p>I believe that learning programming will enable me to make several social impacts in the lives of others. The first impact that I intend to make is via a mobile app that I would like to develop as one of my projects for class. Upon engagement, this app would record audio and video footage of the interaction between a police officer and a civilian. Live streaming will enable anyone logged into a corresponding website to view footage in real time. This platform will allow visibility into both police mistreatment and appropriate peace officer conduct. Visibility will offer some objectivity with regard to matters such as police brutality and the growing distaste towards cops in general in the United States.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and hopefully on a grand scale, I will use my education and new career to inspire young women to take up careers in technology. I would love to partner with an organization like WIT that encourages girls and young women to embrace tech and make their stamp on the industry.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Gender Disparity in Tech</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">September 19, 2015 by <a href="/homes/about">Shawnte&acute Arrington</a></p>

            <p>Dispersing this looming disparity is crucial to the future of tech as a whole. First and foremost, bridging this gap just makes sense. Women make up over half the population, comprise half of tech users, are leading adopters of mobile, web, and social media devices and services, and are also reported to outperform their male counterparts in leading tech start-ups, generating more revenue with less capital.</p>
            <p>Women don't just belong in tech, they should be occupying roles that influence and direct the future of tech. We can likely agree that women are responsible for most purchasing decisions and consumer spending, making them an economic force to be reckoned with. Consequently, the gender gap serves as persistent blind spot for tech companies looking to gain insight into the outlooks and needs of this group. And because the industry is missing out on these insights, it's inevitably losing out on innovative ideas and lucrative opportunities to enhance business performance.</p>
            <p>Diversity is a key component of new ideas, productivity, financial performance, and thriving in today's economy--an economy in which job growth in the computing industry is significantly outpacing population growth. If more women don't begin to acquire tech-related jobs, the industry's current inability to fill job openings will worsen, resulting in tech companies lacking the necessary workforce to scale into the future. Conclusively, scalability is composed of the ability to see a problem from a multitude of angles paired with an arsenal of problem-solving weaponry, which can only be derived from building a gender-diverse group of problem-solvers.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Career Reinvention</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 31, 2015 by <a href="/homes/about">Shawnte&acute Arrington</a></p>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">

            <p>The key is to know that things are going to change, to be okay with that, and to be ready and willing to change with them--in a word, adaptability. I believe that adaptability is the new stability. And I believe that a successful career is a stable one, a guaranteed one, and one in which you are indispensable and in demand. The ability to adapt is essential to any process, to any desire to remain relevant, and to any probability of surviving. I've never seen a flower bloom that didn't lean into the sun. By this, I mean if you are not willing to move with your source of sustenance, you will not flourish. If you cannot evolve as the economy and as your profession evolve, your skill set will one day be obsolete.</p>
            <p>Today, it's vital to your career to remain in permanent beta--to be ever working on developing a better version of yourself. Just as any system intent upon being around for a while, be it the legal system, a biological system, etc., you must constantly bend and stretch so as not to break, i.e. become unemployable. Taking things one step further, by seeking change, as opposed to being subject to it, you are not only giving yourself a greater sense of control over your future, but also placing yourself ahead of the curve. To seek change is to strengthen your adaptability and essentially to be a pioneer in your field. Pioneers are not only indispensable and in demand, but create the changes to which the rest of us must adapt. By choosing to adapt, by choosing to be a pioneer, you are not only choosing to be successful, you will be.</p>
